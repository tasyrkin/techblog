Since features of modern operating systems require more and more memory, the old laptops with small amount of memory and poor CPU frequency may not be used properly.
<br/>
<br/>
In a world of Linux one such example is Ubuntu 12.04. The operating system supports a CPU consuming visual effects, for example, switching between windows.
<br/>
<br/>
In such situation an OS with small memory consumption is a must. One such an OS is a lightweight Linux OS named Lubuntu. At the start it consumes around 100M, which allows comfortably programming with such tools as Eclipse and web Browser.
<br/>
<br/>
In order to install Lubuntu one may go to their official website <a href="http://lubuntu.net/">http://lubuntu.net/</a> and download their distribution.
Or if have already installed some OS, such as Ubuntu, you may want to simply install Libuntu desktop with:
<br/>
<br/>
<code>sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop</code>
