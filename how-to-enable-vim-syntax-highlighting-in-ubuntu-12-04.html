There are much information on the internet, about how to enable syntax highlighting in Ubuntu.<br />
Some of them advice using the command :syntax=on, another saying about installing vim-full.<br />
These&nbsp;advises&nbsp;are valid for earlier versions of&nbsp;Ubuntu, but not for the 12.04.<br />
So in order to enable syntax&nbsp;highlighting&nbsp;one has to install vim-gnome and it will be enabled automatically:<br />
<code>
sudo apt-get install vim-gnome
</code>
