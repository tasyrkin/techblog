Today I have discovered an important difference between <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_node/find_html/Regular-Expressions.html#Regular-Expressions">regular expressions</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_node/find_html/Shell-Pattern-Matching.html">shell patterns</a> in a context of file searching in Linux. Their both applications may be found in a powerful utility <i>find</i>. Its arguments -name, -path and -wholename are interpreted as shell patterns, and -regex - as regular expressions.
<br/>
The difference between regular expressions and shell patterns is in how some characters are interpreted. 
<br/>
Let's consider a star character (*). In shell pattern it is interpreted as match of zero or more characters. In regular expression is interpreted differently: it matches preceding  character or group zero or more times.
<br/>
For example, the string '*tmp' will match all strings ending with <i>tmp</i> by shell pattern processor, but regular expression processor won't match anything at all! In order to write an equivalent regular expression of a shell pattern we have to write '.*tmp'. 
<br/>
These commands are equivalent:
<br/>
<code>
find . -name '*tmp'
</code>
<br/>
<code>
find . -regex '.*tmp'
</code>
<br/>
So be careful when writing matching expressions and know how it is interpreted.
